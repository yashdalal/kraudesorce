For our midterm MVP, we proposed that we would build a simple iOS app.

>  - An app that would use location services to find the users current location. 
>  - If the user was detected to be inside Holmes Lounge, the screen would turn green.

We have successfully built this goal and have started working towards our end of semester MVP.
